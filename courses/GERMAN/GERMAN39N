For many people, law is the subject of professional legal education, while literature belongs to the humanities. In this seminar, we will see that law and literature, professional school and the humanities are in fact closely related. We will read some of the greatest authors in world literature \u2013 Shakespeare, Melville, Morrison, Kleist, Kafka, among others \u2013 and see how their works engage with the key issues of law such as justice and equity, rights and obligation, crime and punishment. At the same time, we will read legal texts and see how law operates by telling stories.
